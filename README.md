# Hotels Management System

## Project description
I've started this project in order to improve my systems analysis skills, to fill the gaps in my knowledge, to learn about system design. Moreover, I want to implement the Data Engineering part: ELT, dashboard creation. 

I will use the [Hotel Booking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking) dataset and some data for DB will be generated.

## **Fiction** Problem Description
Valmont is a hotel chain, which owns 10 hotels in the country. It uses on old decentralized information system. This leads to huge wastes of the businesses resources in terms of costs and efforts. The companyâ€™s customer satisfaction index is falling as compared to their competitors.

New system allows to connect all the hotels into one network, which is easier to manage. It will make booking process faster and convinient and reporting will help to improve marketing strategy. 

## System Description
**HMSystem** is a web-based application, which helps to simplify hotel operations. This system will unite hotels into big network. It covers major aspects of hotel management:

- hotel online booking;
- providing hotel rooms information;
- decision making;

The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the hotel activities.

## Introduction

A **Systems Analyst** is a professional responsible for analyzing, designing, and implementing information systems to meet the needs of an organization. They work closely with IT teams and business users to identify and document system requirements, develop project plans, and manage system development projects.

Their main functions on the project are

- gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders;
- developing functional and technical specifications;
- designing and implementing information systems;
- conducting system testing and quality assurance;
- collaborating with project managers, developers and other stakeholders;
- ensuring the project meets business and technical objectives;
- providing support and maintenance for the system after deployment.

## Project Description

This project is done with the goal of practicing skills in systems analysis. Its implementation will be presented in two parts: System Design (I), ETL + Reporting (II).

Let's imagine that a representative of a hotel chain asked us to develop an information system capable of effectively managing hotel processes. 

I will use the [Hotel Booking](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking) dataset and some data for DB will be generated.
